                <p>Being lazy is apparently a fine line to walk, too much and you’ll end up with too much work and too little time but too little and you find yourself up at “3 in the morning coding away for no good reason” – I think quite a nice way to round it off was to say that being lazy means balancing effort and enjoyment so that you can comfortably skim the bottom level of what’s needed with the minimum necessary workload. Well rather awfully that completely went against my last blog post but ah well, it seems that section was more for sharing Billy’s ideas than my own.
 I always thought coding was more of an independent thing where everyone gets their head down and does it all themselves, for some reason at AS we were all expected to find our own path to the same door which I never got. Anyway, after just ONE session I’ve been told that it’s actually more about cutting the corners that you comfortably can so when facing a problem that many have faced before you, rather than finding your own way in we’re supposed to go in the front door and copy something that someone else did. So after all these years of IT teachers and Computing tutors telling me how plagiarism is the work of the devil I’ve finally come to the conclusion that all of them were just trying to hide the fact that they don’t really care about it…I guess that’s why they were all so lazy, apparently only the best ones are.
