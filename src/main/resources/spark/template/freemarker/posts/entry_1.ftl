                <h3>Hello Readers, this be a forced blog!</h3>
                <p>Why do I want to get out of this residential course? Well anyone goes to Villiers Park for the qualifications – at the end of the day it would still get people going there if the food was almost inedible and the activities weren’t in any way fun…So there’s that. On a different note though it’s been turned into a pretty social activity and even though it’s essentially a course for people not known for being talkative and interesting these people seem to the 1% that don’t quite fit that. I’d quite like to get a few social and communicative skills from this course and from the looks of things it already seems like that’s happening so it’s going pretty well in my good books. As far as presenting skills go mine could definitely do with some improvement but with almost anything it’s just a matter of practice, the Friday group presentation is making me a little nervous because obviously it’s a lot of pressure but it’s kind of motivating me and making me want to something more than just the bare minimum. I guess what I really want from the end of this is something I can look back on with pride, something to know that I did and+ damn well at that.</p>
