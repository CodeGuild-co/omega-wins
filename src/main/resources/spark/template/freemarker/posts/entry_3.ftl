          <h3>Third proper blog post now</h3>
          <p>So today I learned of the Great War that wages between the vim users and the….other software users, according to the wise and wonderful Billy it seems to be almost a feud between the two parties and I can’t for the life of me fathom how anyone can love a text editor that much. Ah, I’m digressing again, back to the point - Since the only one I’ve used a substantial amount would be Notepad++ I guess I’ll talk about the pros and cons of that for a short while. Of course it’s not the worst looking software I’ve ever seen so it gets a thumbs up from me in that area but it’s hardly excelling in that department, however in functionality it’s technically the BEST I’ve ever used (I played with Vim for 5 minutes so it counts). Some genius in development had a stroke of genius and decided that the code should be collapsible into different chunks so the entirety of “<head>” could be collapsed when you don’t need to look at it. Now that may not seem like much but when I was dealing with a mountain of code and curiously clicked on the little minus symbol I’ve never been happier, I went from having about two pages to scroll through to about 10 lines and everything became so much clearer. For people like me who are much more efficient with smaller chunks it’s invaluable and a definite reason to go with notepad++ and stick with it.

Well here comes the comparison bit, I being me decided that Adobe’s rather wonderful Brackets would be the best one to look at because a) I’d like to see if it works as well as it looks and b) I might even change from Notepad if it works well enough because I’m just that shallow. Well after a short look I can instantly see that it’s missing the collapsing feature but I can live with that I guess as what caught my eye was the amount of add-ons including one called GITHUB INTEGRATION!

<p>
Brackets is open source and apparently very modular so it’s one of the most extensible text editors I’ve ever heard of, it’s ability to have so much more than the standard functions and be able to make it truly your own...plus pretty
